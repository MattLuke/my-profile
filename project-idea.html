									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<!-- Updated 17 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											This project will detail the development of a platform that will allow Information Technology (IT) professionals with an aptitude for a specific area of IT to engage with organisations (vendors) that require a contractor due to lack of in-house IT skills. The platform will primarily be accessed via a desktop and mobile web browser but will also a feature a limited mobile application (app) in the initial release that will be available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The platform will boast key features such as verified user profiles for both IT professionals and vendors, detailed quoting using pre-filled information, the ability to make secure payments between users, and high levels of vetting that will provide vendors with security when choosing to outsource to a contractor.

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<!-- Updated 17 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											Two of the biggest problems faced by the IT industry is the lack of IT professionals readily available including the lack of skills available within IT teams and data privacy concerns when outsourcing work to independent IT contractors. Richard White, the CEO of WiseTech told Robertson (2019), “Australia's tech sector could employ another 200,000 people overnight [if] they had the required skills” and goes on to say that due to the restrictions on visas and immigration to Australia the IT sector struggles to employ international talent as well. The CIO of a major bank also noted in a journal that one of their most pressing concerns in a relationship between and outsourced IT consultant and themselves was that of trust (Dhillon, Syed and Sá-Soares, 2017).

									<h2>Description</h2>
									<!-- Updated 17 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											The solution to overcome these two problems is to create a digital platform that will allow vendors to harness IT expertise of professionals remotely as well as providing vendors peace of mind when outsourcing work to third party consultants. The platform will do this by hosting verified profiles for both the IT professionals and the vendors. Verification will happen through different vetting strategies with the minimum level consisting of a secure identification check against an Australian driver licence, Australian passport or foreign passport so that you only have a network of real people.  
											<br> 
											Expertise would also be something the needs to be verified. IT professionals would have the option or connect their account to GitHub which would allow the platform to gauge the level of skills that they have; taking into account things such as the number of projects collaborated on and the language of different commits pushed (i.e. java, HTML, python, C++, etc.).  
											<br> 
											Profiles would also have recommendations that will allow for new users to have their current managers corroborate a person's skill level as well as for skills to be added by vendors after each project. In a later development the platform would also host the ability to test skill level using in-built tests. For example, if the IT professional wants to include on their profile that they have experience coding Java, the platform would be able to verify how much experience they have by asking them to complete tests such as correcting an error in a script of Java. 
											<br> 
											Additional basic checks such as professional training could be included through third party vendors such as Equifax to confirm that has person has undertaken and completed professional tertiary training. 
											<br> 											
											The platform would also bring about peace of mind for IT professionals by incorporating a secure payment system. This would mean that the vendor surrenders an agreed sum to the platform prior to the IT professional commencing any work on a project. Before this happens, a project would be created by a vendor in the platform which would contain a description of the work they are seeking to be undertaken, or the nature of the engagement between the vendor and IT professional. From this description pre-filled quotes would be sent from the IT professional to the vendor and negotiations would occur until both parties digitally agree to the terms. Once everything has been agreed to, the sum of the quote would be held by the platform and released to the IT professional upon completion of the project. If working in an hourly capacity the IT professional and the vendor would calculate the total amount of hours on a weekly basis prior to the week commencing and variations would be submitted to the platform retrospectively. The platform, as well as the iPhone and Android application, would allow for the IT professional to mark off a summary of what was completed for the project including time logs of how long different tasks took, this could be used if a dispute was to arise between the two parties.  
											<br> 
											The platform would also have the option to show future bookings for the IT professional so that vendors could take this into account when approaching someone for their project.
