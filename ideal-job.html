									<h2>Why this position?</h2>
									<!-- Updated 16 June 2020 -->
									<p>
										I love leading teams and I love innovation. In an IT Manager position like the one being offered by Hassett, I would be able to do both of these things. I would hope to have a position like this that allows me to drive the business forward by innovating new technologies or processes or improving the current ones while leading a small team of IT professionals.  
										<br>
										This particular IT Manager position strikes a chord with me as it is working for a Not-For-Profit (NFP) organisation, something that has been a constant in my work since my professional career began.

											<h3>What skills I already have</h3>
											<p>
												From my professional career so far I have already developed experience in leading small teams and have strong management experience under my belt. Although I do not have any formal qualifications I do have informal experience in administration of different Microsoft SharePoint sites and have incorporated existing software with Microsoft PowerAutomate to make some processes automated. 
												<br>
												I also have experience with setting up of IT hardware and a good understanding of common business applications, as well as introducing new applications business wide however this has not been part of a formalised road mapped plan.  
												<br>
												In addition to this I have really strong knowledge of the social services sector and understand operational requirements of Not-For-Profit organisations that work within this space. In two of my previous positions I have worked with developers to influence the creation of CRMs so that they have all the needed functions for the business to run smoothly and to support the clients. 
											</p>
										</div>
									
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h3>What skills I need</h3>
											<p>
												This position would require someone who has a strong understanding of cloud based software, especially in the administration of Microsoft Office 365, as mentioned in the job ad. I also believe that network management for functions like VoIP would be critical as it makes reference to a call centre like environment and in a community services organisation you would constantly need to be available for inbound calls from victims of domestic violence, people experiencing homelessness, etc. In this position you would also need to have a proven record or developing and implementing IT roadmaps across businesses. All of this would need to be formalised in qualifications such as a Bachelor of IT and/or short courses for different applications. 
												<br>
												As you would be leading a small team and needing to be in constant communication to other departments across the business, strong soft skills would be crucial as well as previous leadership experience and managing teams. 
												<br>
												Additionally, I believe that having a sound understanding or experience working within the social services sector and knowledge of the different reporting portals, funding methods, legislation and client data privacy would be a good upper hand in this role but not something that would be mandatory.

											<h3>How do I fill in the gaps from what I have with what I need?</h3>
											<p>
												Although I've got some great skills and experience up my sleeve, in order to completely satisfy the requirements of the IT Manager position I will need to initially complete my Bachelor of Information Technology as this will allow me to move into a more entry level IT job and formalise my training. A good foundation would be to take up a position that is going to provide me with 360ยบ knowledge of a business such as a helpdesk position or for an agency that contract services to multiple small businesses. 
												<br>
												Once I sure a position in IT I will be able to upskill myself with real world experience and have formalised experience administrating Microsoft 365 as well as working in other applications. This will also teach me how to create and work on IT roadmaps. 
												<br>
												As I already have good soft skills and have proven experience leading teams I would aim to quickly move into a more senior or leadership type position where I can learn how to lead a team with an IT focus. 
												<br>
												From there I would hope to be able to move into a management position for 3-5 years where I can get some very solid experience.
