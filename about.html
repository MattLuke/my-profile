										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>My home</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/brisbane_city.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										I was born and raised in sunny Brisbane, Australia (pictured left). 
										<br>
										I called South East Queensland home until I was 22 years old which was when my partner and I decided to move to Melbourne, Australia. We've been living in Melbourne, our new home, since early 2019 and have been enjoying the vibrance of the city, the coffee, and the hustle-and-bustle of a place that never sleeps.
										<br>
										Although my LinkedIn explains it better than I can here, I started me professional career in 2015 when I joined a Polish specific organisaton in the community services sector. Since then I have always been involved in social work in one way or another, moving from one service provider to another until 2019 when I started working for a specialist recruitment agency that recruits for Social Workers in Victoria.

									<h2>My education</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/university.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									When I graduated high school I decided that because I was rather good at listening to all of my friend's problems that I would study psychology. I must have figured that I might as well have been getting paid for all the advice I was giving out. Plus, I didn't mind the idea of just sitting in a lounge chair all day listening to the woes of others and helping them find solutions.
									<br>
									Cut to when I started studying and discovered that psychology was not like what I had imagined at all! So, after a year of fulltime study, I decided that it wasn't right for me and neither was studying university on-campus. 
									<br>
									Through my studies I did learn that I really enjoyed statistics and that I've got some good knowledge of Excel, so started studying an online Bachelor in Accounting. Unfortunately starting full-time work meant that those studies didn't last very long and after a few lectures I decided to withdraw from the course. 
									<br>
									University and I took a break for a few years until to now as I have decided to enroll into a Bachelor in Information Technology and I am absolutely loving it. For the first time in a long time I'm enjoying learning again and I'm excited to see where it takes me.

										<h3>What these results mean for me?</h3>
											<p>
												Although these results should be taken with a grain of salt, I think that there is a lot of truth in them, I have definitely always been a tactile learner and thrived doing hands-on work. I also think that the Myers-Briggs personality test is an apt reflection of what I am like although there are some generalisations or extremities of the personality type that I don't think is an accurate reflection of me. 
												<br>
												The Big 5 personality test I didn't find to be very insightful, it seemed to rank very modestly and generalised a lot of the personality traits. All-in-all I think that the results are generally accurate, but reflect where you idle on a day-to-day. I believe that anyone's actions or reactions are circumstantial and will vary. 
											</p>
										
										<h3>What these results mean for me when working in a team?</h3>
											<p>
												These results mean that when I'm working in a team I can be quite flexible and easy going, I'm more than happy to jump in and help out or take a look at what you're doing because it's new and interesting. If you're asking for feedback be prepared for honesty, sometimes I can unintentionally be quite direct when communicating and forget about the emotional connection people have with their work. A team I work with can expect great enthusiasm as I will spring into my work and incorporate a little humour wherever I can. I'm spontaneous but contentious about rationality and won't do something that doesn't make sense to me. In a team that I'm leading you can expect to be treated how you'd like to; I don't often give direction and prefer that you manage your work and time the way that suits you best. I'll also offer practical, honest and fair advice when you ask for it. 
											</p>

										<h3>What should I take into account when forming a team?</h3>
											<p>
												When forming a team it is important for me to be more thoughtful of the personalities of the other members; if comfortable it would even be good to share our personality profiles so we can get more of an understanding of one another, our work styles and how we learn. 
												<br>
												It will be important to establish clear methods of communication early on so that we donâ€™t fall into autonomous work patterns as well as divide up tasks so that we understand our responsibilities and contributions from the early stages.
