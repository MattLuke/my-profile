									<h2>My home</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/brisbane_city.jpg" alt="" /></span>So you want to get to know me a bit closer, eh? I get it, that home page didn't give you all the juicy details.<br>  
										Well, you already know I'm Matt. I was born in raised in sunny Brisbane, Australia and lived there all my life until I was 22 years old when I decided to move to Melbourne, Australia.<br>
										I've been living here since 2019 and have been really enjoying the fresh breath of a new and vibrant city. <br>

									<h2>My education</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/brisbane_city.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									When I graduated high school I decided that since I was really good at listening to everyone's problems that I would study psychology.I might as well have been getting paid for all the advice
									I was giving out. Plus, I didn't mind the idea of just sitting in a lounge chair all day listening to the woes of others and helping them find solutions. <br>
									Cut to when I actually started studying and it was not like what I had imagined at all! So, after a year, I decided that Psychology wasn't right for me and neither was on-campus study.  <br>
									About a year later I remembered how I really enjoyed learning statistics in Psychology and how I'm not too shabby at Excel so started studying an online Bachelor in Accounting. That didn't 
									last very long when I listened to my first lecture and wanted to bash my head into the table. 
									Fastforward a few years to now, studying for a Bachelor in Information Technology and absolutely loving it. For the first time in a long time I'm enjoying learning again and I'm excited to see 
									where it takes me.</p>

										<h2>My personality</h2>
										<h4>According to Myers-Briggs</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/MyPersonality.png" alt="ISTP-T" /></span>

									<p>
										ISTP-T stands for <strong>Introvert</strong>, <strong>Sensing</strong>, <strong>Thinking</strong>, <strong>Perceiving</strong> and <strong>Turbulent</strong>.<br>
										Don't get me wrong, I love a party. Being predominately introverted for me means that after a lot of time around lots of people I need time alone, to recharge my social batteries. It also means that I am very careful at listening and won't always domineer a conversation. I also means I'm good at picking up social cues which make me good at reading situations.
