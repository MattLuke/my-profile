										<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>

									<h2>Where it all began...</h2>
									<!-- Updated 16 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											According to my mum, my interest in IT started from the moment I learnt what buttons were. I loved to push button she tells me. So much so, that one day when I was about 5 I managed to push the silent alarm button at a bank and "embarrass her to death".  
											<br>
											The first time that I remember becoming properly infatuated with IT was when my grandmother purchased her first computer. It was a gigantic machine that weighed as much as toddler, would take (what felt at the time) an eternity to start up and loaded images 1 row of pixels at a time. 
											<br>
											It was the first computer in my family, and being that it had a lot of buttons, I helped her set it up and taught her how to use it. 
											<br>
											My grandmother was a very creative lady and bought the computer so she could download knitting patterns and design new embroidery templates.  
											<br>
											Not long from there I got my first phone, a black and white NOKIA, that wasn't good for anything other than playing snake and taking calls for a few minutes. Then my first family computer, first Gameboy, laptop, iPad, PlayStation and so on. 
											<br>
											I don't have extensive professional experience in IT but I have been involved in hardware setup, basic IT support and have worked with developers to create new healthcare systems for the aged and disability sectors. I've also taught myself how to use and administrate some of the Microsoft Office 365 platform and have developed a SharePoint site for my team at work, automated some work processes using Power Automate and integrated some API's to automatically check compliance documents. 									
										</p>

									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<!-- Updated 16 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											I decided to study with RMIT because it was recommended to me. Back in 2014 I had just started working at a Not-For-Profit organisation in Brisbane and began working closely with our IT contractor, Patryk.  
											<br>
											Patryk worked for himself supporting different businesses with their ongoing IT needs. After talking to him about the positives and negatives he experienced when working for himself I asked him what he did to be able to get to this position. He told me about his online studies with RMIT which helped accelerate his business and expand his knowledge. 
										</p>

									<h2>What I hope to learn...</h2>
									<!-- Updated 16 June 2020 -->
										<p>
											While studying Information Technology I expect to develop my skills so that I can create, install and administrate various IT systems and software.  
											<br>
											At a minimum I am hoping to gain a thorough knowledge of the skills needed to provide ongoing maintenance and administration to an organisations IT infrastructure. I also expect that I will become more fluent in my ability to read and write in various programming languages, which will allow me to create applications, develop websites and automate processes. 
											<br>
											I hope that after a completing the foundation classes and a few core subjects that I will have learnt enough about various IT roles to refine my goals and set a more detailed path on how I can achieve my ideal position.
